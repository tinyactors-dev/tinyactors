// The application: a device platform whose devices are actors of the
// platform's own chart, and whose customers upload alert rules that the
// platform runs for them, untrusted, in the quickjs sandbox.
//
// - The fleet is one host on the native datamodel: charts/device.scxml is
//   the platform's code, trusted. Each device's telemetry goes to the
//   `urn:iot:telemetry` I/O processor, which routes a reading to the rules
//   of the device's customer.
// - Each rule is a host of its own on quickjs, with `maxOps` and
//   `memoryLimit`: one sandbox per rule. The engine's memory limit is the
//   whole engine's, every actor of the host together, so a rule that hoards
//   memory in a variable would make every rule beside it fail its next
//   allocation (test.mjs shows it); in a host of its own it hurts only
//   itself. One actor per device the rule watches holds that device's
//   state (its streak, whether it is firing).
// - A rule may raise alerts through `urn:iot:alert` and do nothing else
//   that leaves its sandbox: a send to another system goes to the rule's
//   transport, which refuses it; an `<invoke>` has no service; a `src`
//   has no resolver.
// - What goes wrong is reported to the customer, in their inbox: compile
//   diagnostics at upload, the rule's error counters (`hostStatsAsync`) at
//   each audit, each refused send. A rule that keeps failing, or keeps its
//   host busy, is suspended: its host is closed, which frees everything it
//   held.
