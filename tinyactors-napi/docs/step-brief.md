You are a step agent building `@tinyactors/node`, a Node-API addon in C for Node.js and Bun, in the monorepo /home/user/tinyactors (directory tinyactors-napi/). A coordinating session dispatches one agent per step of the plan and gives you exactly one step. The maintainer is not available: do not ask questions; decide, and log what you decided.

## Read first, in this order
1. /home/user/tinyactors/AGENTS.md (root rules: tests, commits, acronyms, at most three parameters, no serialization on the hot path, lifetimes).
2. /home/user/tinyactors/tinyactors-napi/AGENTS.md (the Node rulebook, updated 2026-10-16 with every decision).
3. /home/user/tinyactors/tinyactors-napi/docs/plan.xml: find your step by id (`//step[@id='...']`), its decisions (`//decision[@id=...]`), the api section, the lifetimes, findings and spikes it cites.
4. The Python binding is the finished model to translate file by file: /home/user/tinyactors/tinyactors-cpython (AGENTS.md, ROADMAP.md with its review findings, src/, tests/, conform/, docs/api-map.md). Reuse its decisions unless the Node rulebook says otherwise.
5. tinyactors-core/docs/embedding.md, bindings.md, boundary.md, requests.md, and the public headers in tinyactors-core/include/tinyactors/ as your step needs. Load the skill files /home/user/tinyactors/.agents/skills/reasoned-analysis/SKILL.md and boundary-design/SKILL.md before any design claim.

## Environment
- `export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH` first: mise is there, and every pinned tool (clang 22, node 22.23.3, bun 1.4.1, ruby 4, ast-grep, zig) comes through it. Use `mise run <task>` inside tinyactors-napi (build, lint, test, conform). `mise which node` / `mise which bun` give the runtimes.
- Scratch files go under /tmp/claude-0/-home-user/5a4b08af-c198-5c53-aa40-9816d84bde9a/scratchpad/<your step id>/.

## Rules for your work
- You own tinyactors-napi/ only. Never edit tinyactors-core, tinyactors-test or tinyactors-cpython. A gap in core or the suite: log it as kind="request-to-core" (below), and work only with what core has; if the step cannot pass without it, implement everything else, log it, and say so in your report.
- **Commit and push often** (the maintainer, 2026-10-17): this container can stop at any moment (a usage limit, a restart), and work that is not on origin/main is lost. Push every passing increment as soon as it passes, at least every hour of work; never leave a finished piece only in the working tree. Work too large for one passing commit is split into passing commits.
- Work on `main`. Commit each small working increment with `git commit -- <paths>` naming only tinyactors-napi paths (git add new files by path first); never `git add -A`, `git commit -a`, `git stash`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- .`. Then `git pull --rebase origin main` and `git push origin main`. If `.git/index.lock` exists, wait and retry; never delete it. Commit subjects: `feat(napi): ...`, `fix(napi): ...`, `docs(napi): ...`, `test(napi): ...`; end every commit message with these two lines:

  Do not put any model name elsewhere.
- Before every commit, `mise run test` in tinyactors-napi must pass (lint, build, tests under node and bun, the conformance gate in mise/napi.rb). Never weaken, skip or delete a check to pass; the gate (GATE/MILESTONE in mise/napi.rb) grows with the work and you only raise it.
- C: our names carry `ta_napi_`; at most three parameters per function (group into structs); bytes as ta_bytes in, ta_buffer out; no mutable globals (instance data); allocation only where the lint allows; ast-grep rules in tools/lint/ with tests for new static checks. Update docs/api-map.md in the same commit as each API item (drop its *planned* mark), and index.d.ts with it.
- Plan and log edits only through XML tooling: `python3 tinyactors-napi/tools/planxml.py`'s classes, e.g.
  `python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'tinyactors-napi/tools'); from planxml import Plan; p=Plan(); p.set(\"//step[@id='STEP']\", 'status', 'done'); p.set(\"//step[@id='STEP']\", 'commit', 'abc1234'); p.save()"`
  and for the log: `from planxml import Log; Log().entry('l-STEP-short-name', 'STEP', 'issue|uncertainty|decision|request-to-core|deviation|note', 'open|resolved|for-maintainer', 'what', why='...', evidence='path:line or output', resolution='...').save()`. Log every uncertainty, every decision you took that the plan did not settle, every deviation from the plan, and every core gap. Mark your step `done` with the commit that finished it when its done-when holds; if it cannot be finished, leave it `doing` and log why.
- Tests in test/*.test.mjs use test/harness.mjs and run under both runtimes; they must not depend on each other, ports or fixed paths.

## Your report (final message, at most 25 lines)
What you built (files), the commits (hashes), the test result of the last `mise run test`, the log entries you added (ids), and anything the next step must know. Be factual; say what does not work.
