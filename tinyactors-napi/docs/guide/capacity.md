# Capacity and memory

A host keeps its actors in blocks of memory it sizes from the config,
one block (a **region**) per segment, that is per `addImage`. You can
leave the sizes to the host, which grows a region when something in it
runs out, or size a host up front for the population you expect. This
guide says what the sizes are, how a region grows, how to read what a
host uses, and what an actor costs.

## The sizes

The config's `system` map gives each new segment its first sizes. Each
key is a whole number; an absent key, or 0, is the default:

| Key | Default | What it counts |
|---|---|---|
| `maxActors` | 64 | actors, hibernated ones included |
| `maxEvents` | 256 | events waiting in the actors' queues |
| `maxTimers` | 64 | pending delayed sends |
| `maxRequests` | 16 | running invocations (child charts and services) |
| `workspaces` | 4 | actors in the middle of a step at once (a sender keeps its workspace until its send is handled); never refused: an actor waits for one, and the host adds more |
| `instanceBytes` | derived from the image and `maxActors` | the actors' variables and states |
| `stringBytes` | 16384 + 16 × `maxActors` | strings the actors hold |
| `ticksPerSecond` | 1,000,000,000 | the host's clock rate |

A size is a segment's first size, not a limit. When a pool fills, the
host grows that segment between runs, into a new region with more of what
ran out and the rest as it was. A pool doubles, or grows by more when
doubling would add less than a quarter of the region, so a small pool
beside a large region does not grow in many small copies. A grown region
never shrinks. A run or an input is refused (`TA_ERROR_NO_MEMORY`) only
when a pool is at its largest size (`maxActors` is at most 8,388,606) or
the system allocator refuses the memory.

## Reading what a host uses

`host.hostStats` ([Inspecting a host](inspection.md)) answers with
`pools`, an array of one entry per live segment, in segment order. Each
entry has its `segment` (the number `addImage` returned) and, for
`actors`, `events`, `timers`, `workspaces`, `requests` and `slabBytes`
(the instance and string memory), the pool's `capacity`, what it holds
now (`used`) and the most it held at once (`highWater`). Each segment
grows on its own, so their pools are reported apart: two images, or a
migration's old and new versions, are two entries.

```js
import { compileCharts, Host } from '@tinyactors/node';

const compiled = compileCharts([{ name: 'idle.scxml', text: `
<scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0"
       datamodel="ecmascript" name="idle"><state id="waiting"/></scxml>` }]);
const image = compiled.image;
compiled.close();

for (const system of [{}, { maxActors: 1000 }]) {
  const host = new Host({ systemID: 'demo', system });
  host.addImage(image);
  const before = (await host.hostStatsAsync()).pools[0].actors;
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) host.spawn(host.chart('idle'));
  const after = (await host.hostStatsAsync()).pools[0].actors;
  console.log(`maxActors ${system.maxActors ?? 'default'}: capacity ${before.capacity}, ` +
    `then ${after.used} used, high water ${after.highWater}, grown: ${after.capacity > before.capacity}`);

  host.addImage(image);
  console.log('segments reported:', (await host.hostStatsAsync()).pools.map((pool) => pool.segment).join(', '));
  host.close();
}
```

```output
maxActors default: capacity 64, then 1000 used, high water 1000, grown: true
segments reported: 0, 1
maxActors 1000: capacity 1000, then 1000 used, high water 1000, grown: false
segments reported: 0, 1
```

`highWater` against `capacity` is what a config sized up front needs: run
a realistic load, read the high-water marks, and give the next host those
sizes. `host.hostConfigAsync()` answers the sizes a host was made with, every
default filled in.

## Sizing a host up front

Growing costs a copy of the region each time, and a grown region keeps
its size, so a host that will hold a known population is better sized for
it. A hibernated actor keeps its slot and its record in the host (about
60 bytes), so `maxActors` counts every actor, while the instance and
string memory are needed for the resident ones only. For `R` actors
resident out of `N` on a counter chart of a few variables, the
repository's hibernation gate uses:

```js
import { Host } from '@tinyactors/node';

const N = 2_000_000; // actors
const R = 1000;      // resident at most
const room = 64;
const host = new Host({ systemID: 'big', system: {
  maxActors: N + room, maxEvents: 4096,
  instanceBytes: 2048 * (R + room), stringBytes: 16384 + 64 * (R + room),
} });
console.log((await host.hostConfigAsync()).system.maxActors);
host.close();
```

```output
2000064
```

A chart with more variables or longer strings needs more per resident
actor; read `slabBytes.highWater` under load to see.

## What an actor costs

Measured with `mise run measure` in the repository (2026-10-17, x86_64
Linux 6.18, Intel Xeon @ 2.10GHz, 4 CPUs, 16 GiB; node 22.23.3, bun
1.4.1): 10,000 actors of a chart with three `<data>`, one of them a list,
resident and idle, in bytes per actor.

| runtime, datamodel | resident | engine heap | region | after one event: resident | heap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| node, native | 1188 | 197 | 287 | 1589 | 281 |
| node, quickjs | 891 | 10 | 287 | 1363 | 11 |
| bun, native | 1632 | 255 | 287 | 2602 | 345 |
| bun, quickjs | 1195 | 24 | 287 | 1602 | 24 |

The engine heap is what the JavaScript engine reports after a full
collection; on quickjs the sandbox's own heap is in "resident" only. The
rest of resident is mostly the engine's fixed cost, which a larger
population spreads thinner: at 40,000 actors the native datamodel is
about 750 bytes resident on Node.js and 970 on Bun. The region here was
sized up front (`maxActors`). A chart whose scripts declare top-level
names costs a `vm` context per actor on top: about 143 KB on Node.js and
60 KB on Bun ([Writing charts](charts.md#scripts)). A hibernated actor
costs about 60 bytes in the host and its blob in your store.

## Work does not grow with the population

`tools/scale.mjs` (`mise run scale` in the repository) times every
operation of the API on a host of N actors and on one of 2N, each in a
process of its own. It fails when an operation costs more than 1.5 times
as much at 2N: per call for an operation on one actor, per actor for one
on the whole population. Most of the actors are hibernated in SQLite and
one in a hundred runs an invoked service; then the same with every actor
resident.

One run of it (2026-10-17, x86_64 Linux 6.18, Intel Xeon @ 2.10GHz, 4
CPUs, 16 GiB, a virtual machine; node 22.23.3, bun 1.4.1). Each cell is
the cost at N, then at 2N, in microseconds, and their ratio.

Hibernated: 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 actors, at most 1000 counters
resident, 20,000 and 40,000 actors each running an invoked service.
