# Migration

Charts change. A long-lived actor (an order that waits a week for its
delivery) is still running when you deploy the chart's next version, and
stopping it would lose its state. A migration moves running actors to the
new version instead, each at a moment when it is at rest, while the host
goes on working.

## Versions and segments

Each `addImage` makes a new **segment** of the host. When an image holds a
chart whose `name` is already in the host, that chart has a new version:
`host.chart(name)` returns the newest, so the actors spawned from then on
are of the new version, and the running ones stay on theirs.

`host.migrate()` moves the running actors to the newest version of their
chart, during the next turns. A moved actor keeps its session, its active
states (matched by id), its queue and its delayed sends with their data.
Its variables do not carry over by themselves, since the new version may
name them differently: the actor first gets the event
`error.platform.upgrade`, whose data holds the old version's variables,
and the new version takes what it keeps from there.

```js
import { compileCharts, Host } from '@tinyactors/node';

const image = (name, text) => {
  const compiled = compileCharts([{ name, text }]);
  const bytes = compiled.image;
  compiled.close();
  return bytes;
};

const v1 = image('counter-v1.scxml', `
<scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0"
       datamodel="ecmascript" name="counter" initial="counting">
  <datamodel><data id="n" expr="0"/></datamodel>
  <state id="counting">
    <transition event="add"><assign location="n" expr="n + 1"/><log expr="'v1 counts ' + n"/></transition>
  </state>
</scxml>`);

// Version 2 renames n to count and counts by ten.
const v2 = image('counter-v2.scxml', `
<scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0"
       datamodel="ecmascript" name="counter" initial="counting">
  <datamodel><data id="count" expr="0"/></datamodel>
  <state id="counting">
    <transition event="error.platform.upgrade">
      <assign location="count" expr="_event.data.n"/>
      <log expr="'upgraded, the old variables were ' + JSON.stringify(_event.data)"/>
    </transition>
    <transition event="add"><assign location="count" expr="count + 10"/><log expr="'v2 counts ' + count"/></transition>
  </state>
</scxml>`);

const host = new Host({ systemID: 'demo' }, {
  log: (host, entry) => console.log(entry.text),
  migrated: (host, moved) => console.log(`session ${moved.session} moved to segment ${moved.segment}`),
  migrationDone: (host, result) => console.log(`migration ${result.migration}: ${result.migrated} moved, ${result.failed} failed`),
});

host.addImage(v1);
const counter = host.spawn(host.chart('counter'));
host.send(counter, 'add');
host.send(counter, 'add');
await host.idle();

host.addImage(v2);                 // the deploy
const id = host.migrate({ chart: 'counter' });
console.log(`started migration ${id}`);
await host.idle();

host.send(counter, 'add');
await host.idle();
host.close();
```

```output
v1 counts 1
v1 counts 2
started migration 1
session 1 moved to segment 1
migration 1: 1 moved, 0 failed
upgraded, the old variables were {"n":2}
v2 counts 12
```

Once no actor runs on an old segment, the host retires it and frees its
memory; `host.hostStats` counts the retired segments
([Inspecting a host](inspection.md)).

## The calls

- **`host.migrate({ chart, session, wake, timeout })`** starts a
  migration and returns its id, a number. With no options it moves the
  actors of every chart; `chart` names one chart, `session` one actor.
  `wake: true` asks for the hibernated actors (below). `timeout` is in
  milliseconds of the host's clock, rounded up to its next tick; 0 or none
  means none. A `chart` the host does not have throws `TA_ERROR_INVALID`
  and a `session` that ended `TA_ERROR_STALE`: a migration that could
  move nothing is refused rather than reported done.
- **`migrationDone: (host, result) => ...`**, in the host's options, gets
  the end of each migration: `{ migration, migrated, failed, pending }`,
  `pending` the sessions (`bigint`s) its timeout left behind. It is a
  handler of the host, so a migration started by a host that was later
  [restored](snapshots.md) reports to the restored host's handler.
- **`migrated: (host, moved) => ...`** gets each actor moved, a view of
  `session`, `segment`, `chart` (its name) and `migration`, valid while
  the handler runs.

## When a migration ends

A migration ends when every actor it looks at has moved, or at its
`timeout`. An actor that is running an invocation waits until the
invocation ends. A hibernated actor moves once it is woken: with `wake:
true` the migration asks for it through your `wake` handler, with the
migration's id as the third argument, and asks again if it finds the
actor hibernated after a wake. Without `wake`, a hibernated actor that
nobody wakes holds the migration until its timeout, or forever without
one, and `migrationDone` is never called: give such a migration a
`timeout`. A migration still running when the host is closed never
reaches `migrationDone`.

## Actors that do not move

An actor that cannot be written out stays on its version and counts as
failed. On the native datamodel that is one whose variables hold a value
outside the value table (a function, a `Map`, a `Date`, ...), or whose
chart's scripts declare with `let`, `const` or `class`, the same actors
[hibernation](hibernation.md) refuses.

On the native datamodel the upgrade event's data holds exactly the old
version's variables. A chart whose scripts declare top-level names gets
its new version's declarations (its scripts are instantiated, not run),
and the old names the new version does not declare are gone.

## Most actors hibernated: wake a batch at a time

A migration with `wake: true` asks for every hibernated actor early. Wake
them all at once and they are all in memory at once. Instead, queue the
migration's requests and wake a batch per round: the migration takes each
woken actor in its next runs. An event's request (`migration` is
`undefined`) still wakes its actor at once, and the migration takes that
one too. Put actors back to sleep once they have moved; one put back
before it moved is asked for again, which costs work but does not stall
the migration.

```js
import { compileCharts, Host, TinyactorsError } from '@tinyactors/node';

const image = (version) => {
  const compiled = compileCharts([{ name: `v${version}.scxml`, text: `
<scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0"
       datamodel="ecmascript" name="counter" initial="s">
  <datamodel><data id="version" expr="${version}"/></datamodel>
  <state id="s"><transition event="error.platform.upgrade"/></state>
</scxml>` }]);
  const bytes = compiled.image;
  compiled.close();
  return bytes;
};

const store = new Map();
const asked = [];
/** @type {import('@tinyactors/node').MigrationResult | undefined} */
let done;
let mostResident = 0;

const host = new Host({ systemID: 'demo' }, {
  wake: (host, session, migration) => {
    if (migration !== undefined) asked.push(session);  // the migration's: a batch at a time
    else host.wake(session, store.get(session));       // an event's: now
  },
  migrationDone: (host, result) => (done = result),
});

function evict() {
  for (const session of host.sweep(1 << 20, 1 << 20)) {
    try {
      store.set(session, host.hibernate(session));
    } catch (error) {
      if (!(error instanceof TinyactorsError)) throw error;
    }
  }
}

host.addImage(image(1));
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) host.spawn(host.chart('counter'));
await host.idle();
evict();
evict();
console.log(`${store.size} hibernated`);

host.addImage(image(2));
host.migrate({ wake: true });
while (done === undefined) {
  for (const session of asked.splice(0, 10)) host.wake(session, store.get(session));
  await host.idle();
  const stats = await host.hostStatsAsync();
  mostResident = Math.max(mostResident, stats.host.actors - stats.host.hibernated);
  evict();
  evict();
}
console.log(`${done.migrated} moved, ${done.failed} failed, at most ${mostResident} in memory at once`);
host.close();
```

```output
100 hibernated
100 moved, 0 failed, at most 10 in memory at once
```

## At scale

`tools/migration.mjs` (`mise run migration` in the repository) is this
pattern at scale: two million actors, at most 1000 resident, the rest in
SQLite.

One run of it (2026-10-16, x86_64 Linux 6.18, Intel Xeon @ 2.10GHz, 4
CPUs, 16 GiB; node 22.23.3, bun 1.4.1): two million actors of version 1
of a counter, at most 1000 resident, 200,000 events before the migration
and 200,000 more during it, every actor moved to version 2 with `wake:
true` (2,218,265 wakes from the store in each run). The migration ended
with every actor migrated, none failed and none left; all 25,000 sampled
actors had their count and version 2; version 1's segment was retired;
and after every eviction at most 1000 actors were resident (plus two
batches while the migration moved them).
