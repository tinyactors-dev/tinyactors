 *              calls encode) allocates above the outer one; its chunks are
 *              kept, so a warmed call allocates nothing;
 *   error      the class TinyactorsError, exported;
 *   object     Object.prototype of this environment's realm: a plain

 *              `clock`, the key of a SimulatedClock's state (loop.c). Node-API
 *              has no private symbols, so a plain Symbol held here is the
 *              key; a reference to an object, not to the symbol, since
 *              references to symbols need Node-API 10;
 *   turn       the function the event loop calls for a turn of a host
 *              (loop.c), given the Host as its argument: one per

 *              (effects.c), bound to its view: it fails an unanswered send
 *              and throws the rejection on;

 *              Invocation (effects.c), made only by the drain;
 *   crashed    the function a service's receive promise calls when it
 *              rejects (effects.c), bound to its invocation and its send:

 *   settled, settled_rejected  the functions the last promise of a
 *              handler's chain calls when it settles (loop.c), bound to the
 *              Host's wrapper: the host's count of pending handler promises
 *              goes down, and a waiting idle() is given a turn at zero;
 *              settled_rejected throws the rejection on;
 *   started, start_failed  the functions a service handler's promise calls
 *              when it settles (effects.c), bound to its invocation: the
 *              service kept and the sends and UNINVOKE queued while it
 *              started given to it in order, or a failed start;
 *   vm, realm  node:vm (process.getBuiltinModule) and the vm.Script of
