/* The native "ecmascript" datamodel's own declarations (AGENTS.md, "The
 * native "ecmascript" datamodel"): what its files share. Of core it calls
 * only ta_datamodel_environment_*, ta_image_*, ta_cbor_* and ta_table_*,
 * txml's txml_* for XML content, and the addon's own ta_napi_*
 * (tools/lint/rules/datamodel-calls-environment-and-node-api.yml).
 *
 * Where a chart evaluates (docs/plan.xml, decision d-declarations):
 *
 *   - a chart whose <script>s declare nothing at their top level runs in
 *     the host's one shared node:vm context: each session is a scope
 *     object made by the chart's constructor, and each expression is one
 *     function of the scope, compiled at its first evaluation, sloppy
 *     outside (`with (scope)`) and strict inside;
 *   - a chart whose scripts declare (var, function, let, const, class), as
 *     the engine says at chart_attach, gets a context per session, whose
 *     global object is the scope: a script runs there as global code, and
 *     closures over its names work.
 *
 * Every context runs the realm's script (realms.c, its "kit"): what is
 * made with that context's constructors (copies of values, scopes,
 * _event, XML nodes) is made by the kit's functions. */
