// The direct layer of @tinyactors/node: loads the addon and re-exports it,
// nothing else (AGENTS.md, "Layers and the resolver"). index.mjs exports
// these names and the convenience layer's (lib/convenience.mjs), which
// imports this module only. In the repository the addon is
// build/tinyactors.node, which `mise run build` makes; an installed package
// has no build/, and its addon is this platform's package,
// @tinyactors/node-<platform>-<arch>, which an install of @tinyactors/node
// brings as an optional dependency at exactly its own version (npm, pnpm
// and Bun install only the one whose os and cpu match).
//
// The development build comes first: Bun, run where no node_modules is
// (the repository), installs a package it cannot resolve from the
// registry, so asking for the platform package there would load the last
// release's addon. The platform package's version must be this package's
// for the same reason.
