// the processor's cache, then stays flat to 160,000), on the datamodel
// under test, each size in a process of its own under this runtime. The
// cost at 40,000 must be within the gate's factor of the cost at 20,000

// operation over it is measured again before it fails, both sizes in new
// processes, up to eight times, each size keeping its least cost, so noise
// does not fail the test and a scan does: a process's costs vary by up to
// 1.6 times from one process to the next (a collection, its heap's
// layout), and four attempts left one operation over in 3 of 8 runs
// (docs/log.xml, l-p2-decisions-scale-gate-noise). The operations known to grow because
// of core (KNOWN, each with its request to core) are reported, not failed.
// `mise run scale` and `mise run test --full` run the same at two and four
// million actors.
